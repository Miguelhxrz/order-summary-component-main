## Overview
     - The challenge for people experienced in CSS and HTML5 is simple, it is enough to know how to implement Flexbox and grid depending on the case, in my case, I have used flexbox 98% on the card, and only 2% of the grid that has been implemented in the payment information section.

## My process
     # My process for Newbie challenges is the same always:
      - I start the repository.
      - I read the style guide.
      - I start to modify and add classes to the html.
      - And I start with the styles.
### Built with

- HTML5 semantic markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexible box
- CSS grid
- Mobile workflow first

### Helpful Resources

- [Neumorphism] (https://neumorphism.io/) - I've never been very good with the box-shadow property and this Neumorphism generator helped me complete the challenge.
